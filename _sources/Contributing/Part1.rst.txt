Introduction
============

This is a guide on how to contribute to chapters in Part 1 of the handbook. We
use checklists to check the quality of each section of the handbook. If this is
news to you then please see `the README
<https://github.com/input-output-hk/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/tree/main/Contributing>`_
to get up to speed on the expected project workflow as a writer.


The Checklist
=============

- [ ] provide the motivation for using the external tool
- [ ] provide a phrase "use this tool when ..."
- [ ] provide the expected output of the tool "With this tool you can retrieve this important information"
- [ ] provide the platforms that support this tool, if a platform does not
  please state either: 1) an alternate tool to retrieve the same information or 2) a statement that this tool is not supported on the platform
- [ ] if you read the first line of each paragraph, they are form a coherent story
  , and that story arrives at the point of the section, within reason.
- [ ] The section has a closing summary that repeats: when to use the tool, what information can be retreived with the tool, which performance issues this tool helps with, and how to run/use the tool.
- [ ] After the summary there is a summary of command line invocations and their corresponding meaning
- [ ] The section has a reference subsection
- [ ] The book builds with the PR (this should be CI)
